# VR-Lifegaurd-Game
This is a VR simulation concept project built to explore immersive lifegaurd training through interactive gameplay. //
Specifically, this demo tests ones ability to do a head count, which is a systematic scan of the swimming area to ensure every swimmer is visible. 
To simulate real life traffic, swimmers spawn in irregular intervals and follow a path using a spline system. The player must use the A and B buttons to add and subtract mentally and see if they got the right answer in the end.
